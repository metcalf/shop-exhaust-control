# Decision Log

ADR-lite format. Status is one of: **Proposed**, **Accepted**, **Superseded by D-nnn**, or **Rejected**. Gate approvals are logged here too.

Keep this log to live decisions. When one is superseded, delete it if the new entry's alternatives already record why; keep a rejected entry only if the idea is likely to be re-proposed. Working assumptions live in `docs/context.md` until they're decided. IDs are never reused.

## D-001: Exhaust fan controller is the pilot project
- Date: 2026-10-22
- Status: Accepted (Andrew)
- Context: Two related projects, exhaust fan control and DC control, plus a new Claude-led design process to try out.
- Decision: Build the exhaust controller first.
- Alternatives considered: DC first (higher value, but more I/O, distributed wiring and a 3 HP motor contactor).
- Consequences: The exhaust project defines the `DC_RUNNING` interface. The DC project reuses this repo's structure and its process notes.

## D-002: Separate controllers, coupled by one signal
- Date: 2026-10-22
- Status: Accepted (Andrew)
- Context: The two systems share only "DC running," plus an optional shared UI.
- Decision: Independent ESP32 nodes. Shared UI and history go in Home Assistant.
- Alternatives considered: One combined controller.
- Consequences: Each node must work on its own (NFR-01). The interface lives in `docs/interfaces.md` §1.

## D-003: Local physical controls; Home Assistant for history and alerts
- Date: 2026-10-22 (revised 2026-10-23)
- Status: Accepted (Andrew)
- Context: Andrew doesn't want to pull out a phone at the bench.
- Decision: Physical controls and indicators in the shop. Need not be analog: a small display is fine, resistive touch possible but physical controls preferred. Not presumed to be a fixed mode list; the interaction model is in `docs/requirements.md` §2. Home Assistant handles logging, notifications and remote viewing, and may trigger the same actions as the panel.
- Consequences: Precedence between panel and Home Assistant is decided at G2 (`docs/interfaces.md` §4).

## D-007: Bare ESP-IDF firmware, reusing the hvac_control network stack
- Date: 2026-10-23
- Status: Accepted (Andrew, 2026-10-23, including extraction)
- Context: Andrew writes ESP32 firmware in bare ESP-IDF. `~/code/hvac_control` already has a working Wi-Fi/OTA/remote-log/MQTT base (`components/wifi`) and two Home Assistant MQTT-discovery clients built on it. The DC controller will need the same stack.
- Decision: ESP-IDF in C++, not ESPHome. Control logic is a pure C++ component, host-tested. Reuse `components/wifi`, extracted with history into `metcalf/esp-iot-core` and consumed as a git submodule at `components/esp-iot-core`, matching how hvac_control already pulls in its other shared libs. HA integration follows the `MqttHomeClient`/`MqttZCHomeClient` pattern.
- Alternatives considered:
  - ESPHome: less code for HA entities, but not Andrew's workflow, and complex logic ends up in C++ external components anyway.
  - Copy `components/wifi` into this repo: fastest, but forks it three ways once the DC project starts.
- Consequences: hvac_control switches to the submodule on branch `extract-esp-iot-core`, mounted at `components/esp-iot-core` (consumers `REQUIRES esp-iot-core`); both firmware builds and host tests pass. `release.sh` takes `OTA_DIR_PREFIX` (default `hvac_control_`); each project sets its own OTA URL template, MQTT user and `remote_spec.cfg` in gitignored per-checkout files. The Python reference model is dropped (Andrew, 2026-10-23); the logic has one implementation, tested on the host in C++.

## D-008: Custom PCB with third-party assembly
- Date: 2026-10-23
- Status: Accepted (Andrew, direction; mains and DIN-rail constraints lifted 2026-10-23); details confirmed at G2/G3
- Context: Andrew wants to try a custom PCB for this project. He has designed mains PCBs before. He can hotplate-reflow SMD and is open to third-party PCBA.
- Decision: v1 uses a custom PCB: ESP32-S3 module, power, PM sensor connector, optocoupled `DC_RUNNING` input, control-panel and indicator I/O, and outputs. Mains on the board is allowed; whether the supply, relay or contactor are on or off board is decided at G2. Mains sections follow IEC 62368-1 creepage/clearance with reinforced insulation to accessible low voltage, documented in `pcb/SAFETY.md` (SR-01a). Enclosure is custom; no DIN-rail constraint. KiCad design, assembled by JLCPCB by default using parts it stocks; leftovers hand-soldered or reflowed by Andrew.
- Alternatives considered:
  - Dev board plus modules: no layout risk, but more wiring and a bigger enclosure. Kept as the fallback on the same pinout.
  - Low-voltage-only board (initial draft): simpler review, but rules out an on-board supply or relay that may make the build smaller. Remains an option at G2.
- Consequences: Phase 3 adds a KiCad project with ERC/DRC and fab/PCBA outputs; G3 review covers the board. The PCB order is a purchase, approved at G4. Claude's layout needs Andrew's review in KiCad. Mains layout is the highest-risk part of Claude's weakest area, so Andrew reviews it at G3 against `pcb/SAFETY.md`.
